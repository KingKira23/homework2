# homework2

when I first started the process of doing this homework I didnt relize that it had to be like the images provided so some aspects of the homework may difer such as the navbar

I made sure that the links for the bootstrap css and java script are in place so the code coming from bootstrap works.

INDEX

when working on the index since it is th homepage this is where I wanted to decide how my pages would look color scheme and navbar apperince because this would perciste through out the all pages.

I then used <container-fluid> to start the use of <rows> to be able to to use <col> to split my content into sections place it centered to the page.

after that i worked within the aloted space i gave myself further spliting the space into to two other rows seperating the <h1> from the <img> and <p>

CONTACT

used the same navbar just changed the to links to go back to the home page and used the same color scheme.

This was the simplist one of the three pages to mess with I first looked on bootstrap for a form the served my needs it had a few extra things that I didnt need so I took the pieces of code out. I then added some missing aspects like the submit button and the header I took the submit button out of a diffrent form I found on bootstrap and applied it to my form.


PORTFOLIO

used the same navbar just changed the to links to go back to the home page and used the same color scheme.

This was the most irrtating page to work on because things were not working the way i thought they would when it was resized to fit a phone like when i got the cards off of bootstrap they came with a set with of 16px which was messing with how everything alinged so i changed it to a % value so it would change to a diffrent sizze until it reached  a point were it was time for it to be pushed down to a lower line.

other then that i also had to change the <col> for when it is at a small screen size because it had a tendency to stick to the sides. it also did the same in the (index.html) so it solved both of them once i figured out that it worked.
